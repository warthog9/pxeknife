Network booting utilities made easy

--== Who's behind PXE Knife? ==--

PXE Knife is loosely based on Ultimate Boot CD, and in fact was inspired by it. It is the brain child of Brian De Smet and John 'Warthog9' Hawley, seeking a means to both give a good, live, working example of the menuing capabilities of pxelinux and seeking a way to eliminate the need for a multitude of floppies and other random utility software.

--== Why aren't there any 'free for personal use' software included in PXE Knife? ==--

While we know there will be a few individuals who have large enough home networks to make running pxe at home realistic, we also realize our primary consumer is going to be corporate entities who are not allowed to use the 'free for personal use' software. To this end we are only willing to include software that doesn't preclude corporations. Sadly this does eliminate a number of pieces of software we would like to include, including anti-virus software. We are constantly on the lookout for new or updated utilities to add to PXE Knife. If you know of a piece of software that we should investigate please let us know.
