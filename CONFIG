# CENTOSMETHOD provides a mechanism to provide the installer with various additional command line
# options
# this *WILL* start out with 
# 	method=<CENTOSMETHOD>
# 	Options include:
# 		- @URL@ - this will fill in the base URL from which is found the installer
# 		- @VERSION@ - the numberic version of the installer
# 		- @ARCH@ - the architecture that your installing
# 		- @MAGICURL@ - this will use a known - predefined path for what your
# 			       using, based on the base URL.  This *HIGHLY* assumes 
# 			       your either using this with the default URLs, or that
# 			       you have changed them to match a full mirror of the distro
#
# 	You can tack on additional options should you choose, like ip=dhcp so that a user
# 	is not asked for their IP address settings.
#
# 	If this is left blank, askmethod is substituted
#
# 	see http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Options for most options used by Anaconda,

#			- Before Debian 5.0 & 4.0r7 the format is Debian-<version number>
#				- Debian-0.93R6
#				- Debian-1.1
#				- Debian-2.0
#				- Debian-3.1
#			- After 5.0 and 4.0r7 the format seems to have changed to Debian<version number>
#				- Debian5.0
#				- Debian4.0r7
#		- Also note you can use the canonical names for releases like:
#			- sarge

#			- slink
#			- rex

#			- buzz
